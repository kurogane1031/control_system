# Control System for beginner with Eigen

Many control system tutorial in the internet is based on Matlab or Python or any other language. C++ example is scarce. Hopefully I can start something with this. 
However, this repository is just served as a refresher for me and just to let me learn Jenkins at the same time.

- [x] check for controllability
- [x] find eigenvalue and eigenvectors
- [ ] controllability gramian
- [ ] PBH test
- [ ] Singular Value Decomposition
- [ ] Cayley Hamilton
